## Current Design

The current design is neat and organized with zip-wires to prevent entanglement and has an open center for easy access to parts. Our machine also has a lower chassis which helps it have a lower center of mass to prevent tipping. The control hub and the expansion hub are mounted on the side of the machine so that wiring is distributed to each side. One side of the claw is opened so the linear slide doesn't need to carry a lot of weight. The linear slide is also added for future design changes. The camera is mounted high to see over the motor and get a better view of the signal, and the front motors upwards to save space. We have also added additional weight to the back to evenly distribute weight.

During the building process, many challenges arose. One of the first problems was speed, as the robot did not move as fast as was needed for the competition. To solve this, we upgraded the drive system by installing 1150 RPM motors, which significantly increase wheel speed and overall mobility. Another issue that we faced was navigation; the robot needed to travel quickly between junctions quickly and go over ground level obstacles. To address this, we raised the base slightly, improving the clearance of the robot without compromising stability. 

Our final major issue was object handling. During initial trials, our claw machanism was slow to open and close, and its grip was inconsistent. We resolved this by adjust the claw's code to speed up its opening and closing abilities as well as adding rubber wheels to improve traction and handling. These modifications allowed us to have a more faster, efficient, and reliable robot competitoons.
