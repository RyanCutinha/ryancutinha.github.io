## Current Design

The current design is neat and organized with zip-wries to prevent entanglement and has an open center for easy access to parts. Our machine also has a lower chassis which helps it have a lower center of mass to prevent tipping. The control hub and the expansion hub are mounted on the side of the machine so that wiring is distributed to each side. One side of the claw is opened so the linear slide doesn't need to carry a lot of weight. The camera is mounted high to see over the motor and get a better view of the signal. We have also added additional weight to the back to evenly distribute weight.

While building the robot, there were several problems that we faced. One major issue was that the robot was not moving as fast as we needed it to, so we attached 1150 rpm motors to the wheels. Another issue that we faced was that the robot needs to navigate between junctions quickly and go over ground junctions, so we then raised the base of the robot slightly. Lastly, our robot had a problem picking up and dropping objects as well as gripping them, so we coded our claws to open and close more quickly and gave them rubber wheels so that they have a better performance.
