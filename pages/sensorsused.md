# Sensors used

While building, we used 4 drive motor encoders, 1 linear slide motor encoder, 1 InHub Gryo, 1 InHub Accelerometer, and 1 Webcam. The drive motor encoders helped the machine to move into its positions, the slide motor encoder moved the arm into position,  the InHub gryo ensures that the machine turns accurately and stays straight, the accelerometer ensured that the machine accelerated properly, and the Webcam is used to scan a signal to start moving.

Some of the sensors used are shown below.

The sensor shown above is called the Drive motor encoder. It was used to move the machine around so that we could go through the mazes.

The sensor shown above is called the Linear Slide Motor Encoder. It was used to move the arm up and down so that it can pick up objects.
