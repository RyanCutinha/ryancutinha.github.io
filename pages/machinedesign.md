## Machine Designs

There were several designs that we used over the course of our project, and each had its pros and cons. For most stages of development, we controlled the robot through joysticks linked to an electronic surface, which transmitted signals wirelessly to the onboard control system. In addition to manual control, we added several sensors that enabled us to program the robot for autonomus control and allowed for the robot to perform several tasks and actions without us intervening. Each design had four wheels, a base, and an arm to pick up objects as they moved around. For most of the project, we controlled the machine via joysticks that were connected to an electronic device that sent signals to the machine.

As our designs evolved, we continously introduced innovations to optimize functionality and increase efficiency. In our first design, we created carbon fiber rods that allowed us to reduce the wight of the arm. This helped to keep a lower center of mass for the robot and improved overall stability. This was especially important when the arm was extended, as it mimized the risk of tipping. 

In our second design, we experimented with a custom dropper mechanism which allowed us to have a completely new approach to object placement. Unlike grippers of other teams, our dropper eliminated the need to actively grab and release objects. The mechanism was designed with one open side so that when it was positioned over a pole, the robot could simply drive away leaving the cone behind without any griiping action. As an addition, we added a pivot point to the dropper, which allowed it to swing freely when the robot made abrupt stops. 

For our third design, we focused on placement accuracy and speed. We added a horizontal aligment beam at the bottom of our robot to match the height of the pole. We knew that fully lining up was impossible as the cone couldnâ€™t be directly over the pole. To fix this we added a button that would drop the cone while moving backward to be super efficient.
