## Machine Designs

The machine that we have built is a small robotic device that can move around places autonomously and with a controller. There were several designs that we used over the course of my project, and each had its pros and cons. Each design had four wheels, a base, and an arm to pick up objects as they moved around. For most of the project, we controlled the machine via joysticks that were connected to an electronic device that sent signals to the machine. Additionally, there were several sensors that we also included so that we could code the machine and move it to several positions, which allowed us to control the machine hands-free. 

There were several innovations that we made for each of our designs as we went along. In our first design, we used carbon fiber rods to reduce the weight of the arm, which helped keep a low center of mass. In our second design, we made our own unique dropper which allows us to not even have to grap objects. The dropper would be lowered over the pole and since one side was open we could just drive away, leaving the cone behind. We even added a pivot point to the dropper so that when the robot abruptly stopped the dropper would swing instead of potentially dropping the cone. For our third design, we added a beam at the bottom of our robot to line up with the pole. We knew that fully lining up was impossible as the cone couldnâ€™t be directly over the pole. To fix this we added a button that would drop the cone while moving backward to be super efficient.
